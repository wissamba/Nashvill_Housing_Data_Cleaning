In this project, I focused on cleaning and preprocessing the Nashville housing data to ensure its quality and readiness for analysis. The objective was to address various data quality issues and transform the dataset into a more usable format.

Skills and Techniques Used:

JOINS: Integrated multiple tables to consolidate relevant information.

Common Table Expressions (CTE): Simplified complex queries by breaking them into manageable parts.

CAST and Converting Data Types: Ensured data consistency by converting data types where necessary.

Aggregate Functions: Calculated summary statistics to identify and handle outliers or anomalies.

POSITION, SUBSTRING, SPLIT_PART, LEFT, RIGHT: Extracted and manipulated specific portions of string data for standardization and correction.

CASE Statements: Applied conditional logic to classify and clean data based on specific criteria.

ROW NUMBER: Indexed rows to assist in identifying duplicates and maintaining order.

ALTER, DROP, DELETE, ADD, REMOVE: Managed and modified table structures to improve data integrity and performance.
Steps Taken:

Data Consolidation: Used joins to integrate various datasets and create a comprehensive view of the housing data.

Data Type Conversion: Applied CAST functions to convert data types, ensuring uniformity across the dataset.

String Manipulation: Utilized POSITION, SUBSTRING, SPLIT_PART, LEFT, and RIGHT functions to clean and standardize string fields.

Conditional Logic: Employed CASE statements to handle exceptions and categorize data appropriately.

Deduplication: Implemented ROW NUMBER to identify and remove duplicate records, ensuring data uniqueness.

Table Management: Used ALTER, DROP, DELETE, ADD, and REMOVE commands to refine table structures and eliminate redundant or unnecessary data.

Results:

Enhanced data quality through rigorous cleaning and standardization.
Improved data consistency and integrity, facilitating more accurate analysis.

The streamlined dataset is ready for further analytical processes and insights extraction.

This project demonstrated my SQL proficiency and ability to handle complex data cleaning tasks, ultimately preparing the Nashville housing data for comprehensive analysis.
